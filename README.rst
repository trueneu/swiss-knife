swiss-knife
===========

An extendable utility for doing everything with self-defined
hosts/hostgroups, utilizing API of your environment, with parallel ssh
out of the box.

Destroying all your databases at once has never been this simple!

::

    swk pssh ^mysql 'sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql'

(yeah, you really shouldn't do that in production environment. Unless
you're angry and desperate.)

What can it do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic idea is: you specify what to do (a command), a list of hosts
or hostgroups to do that with, and additional arguments if needed
(depends on what you want to do). You can easily define your own
commands through the plugin interface, as well as your own hostgroup
parsers (usually they'll just ask some API in your environment about
which hosts are included in provided hostgroup). Basic Foreman, Zabbix
API and ssh functions are supported out of the box.

Please note that this is *not* ``fabric``.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pip install swk

If you need plugins for casp, Foreman or Zabbix, also run

::

    pip install swk-casp
    pip install swk-foreman
    pip install swk-zabbix

Upon first execution \`swk\`\` will create **~/.swk** directory, where
you should find **swk.ini** configuration file, and that's used to store
shell mode command history, program's log, various plugins' cache, etc.

Please note that you should use python3.2+ for shell mode to work.
Everything else should work with python2.7.

Usage
~~~~~

Typical usage looks like

``swk pssh "%hostgroup1[ [-]^hostgroup2 .. host1 [-]host2]" uptime``

which executes uptime on all the hosts over ssh in parallel fashion.

``%``, ``^`` and other non-alphabetical characters are treated as
hostgroup modifiers which indicate which parser should expand a given
hostgroup into a host list. hyphen (``-``) in front of hostgroup or a
host means that hostgroup or host will be excluded from resulting list.
A host may be a simple regex (no \* quantificator or anychar (.), no
lookahead/lookbehinds), ``swk`` will generate strings that match it and
use it as hosts. If you're excluding hosts that aren't included yet,
nothing happens. Hostlist is expanded from left to right. Example:

``swk pssh "^g1 -host[1234]" echo Yay``

will execute ``echo Yay`` in parallel fashion on each host that's in
zabbix hostgroup ``g1`` except hosts ``host1``, ``host2``, ``host3`` and
``host4``.

Available and bundled plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the box, swk supports: - running commands over ssh (``ssh`` and
``pssh`` commands), copying files over ssh to multiple hosts (``dist``
command, recursive and without preserving times by default), copying
files from multiple hosts over ssh (``gather``) - and just displaying
results of hostlist expansion (``dr`` for 'dry-run')

By installing additional packages named ``swk-<plugin_name>``, you also
get - expanding **zabbix** hostgroups (``^`` modifier), **casp**
hostgroups (``%`` modifier), special ``ALL`` hostgroup expanding to all
the hosts - getting and setting hosts environments in **Foreman**
(``getenv`` and ``setenv`` commands), getting, adding and removing
classes linked to hosts and hostgroups (``getcls``, ``addcls``,
``rmcls``, ``getgcls``, ``addgcls``, ``rmgcls`` respectively), searching
hosts and hostgroups based on given criteria (``srch`` and ``srchg``),
listing available classes (``lscls``) and describing hosts (``desc``).

To install them, please refer to `Installation <#Installation>`__
section above.

Hopefully, there are more coming.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Imagine that you need to grep all your frontend nginx logs for string
'/api/do\_something'. Your frontend hostnames are ``frontend00``,
``frontend01``, ..., ``frontend99``. You could use something like

``swk pssh frontend[0-9][0-9] grep '/api/do_something' /var/log/nginx/access.log``

You can interrupt the command execution at any moment with Ctrl-C.

Suppose your servers are named a bit more sophisticated, like
``frontend01``, ``frontend02``, ..., ``frontend25``. This command would
do the trick (note the quotes around host expression):

``swk pssh 'frontend([0-1][0-9]|2[0-5]) -frontend00' grep '/api/do_something' /var/log/nginx/access.log``

You can always verify if you did the host expression right:

``swk dr 'frontend([0-1][0-9]|2[0-5]) -frontend00'``

Output:

::

    frontend01
    frontend02
    <...skipped...>
    frontend24
    frontend25

Suppose you also have servers ``backend01``, ``backend02``, ...,
``backend10``, and you want to run ``uptime`` on both frontends and
backends. Try this one:

``swk pssh 'frontend([0-1][0-9]|2[0-5]) -frontend00,backend(0[1-9]|10)' uptime``

Now imagine you have to execute a certain script named ``test.sh`` on
those 25 frontends locally. First, copy it to target hosts:

``swk dist 'frontend([0-1][0-9]|2[0-5]) -frontend00' ./my_scripts/test.sh /usr/share/``

and then execute it:

``swk pssh 'frontend([0-1][0-9]|2[0-5]) -frontend00' /usr/share/test.sh``

Imagine you need to do something with nginx logs locally on your
computer (say, a simple statistics calculation). You can gather all the
logs to your machine with one command:

``swk gather 'frontend([0-1][0-9]|2[0-5]) -frontend00' /var/log/nginx/access.log ./nginx-logs-from-production``

This will create 'nginx-logs-from-production' directory in your current
working directory, and copy over all the access.log files, appending a
suffix so you can tell from which host each log has been copied.

Say you have a Zabbix installation in your environment, and all the
frontends are in 'frontend' hostgroup. You can do the same as above
using zabbix hostgroup expansion (note that ``zabbix`` module is
disabled by default. More on that in `Available
plugins <#available-and-bundled-plugins>`__ section above)

``swk gather ^frontend /var/log/nginx/access.log ./nginx-logs-from-production``

You probably already have some cli tools for finding hosts falling under
some search criteria. Suppose you have a tool that's called
``my_awesome_tool`` which returns some hostnames on call, like this:

::

    $ my_awesome_tool
    host1
    host2
    host3

If you want to use your tools as a source for hostlists for ``swk``, you
can achieve this in two ways:

::

    swk pssh "`my_awesome_tool`" uptime

or

::

    my_awesome_tool | swk pssh - uptime

where ``-`` instead of host expression indicates that ``swk`` reads from
stdin.

Imagine that you have Foreman installation and you need to set all the
frontends' environments to 'development' (note that you still use ^
here, so host expansion mechanism works with Zabbix hostgroups)

``swk setenv ^frontend development``

...or add to frontend Foreman hostgroup your brand new
``nginx::verbose_access_logs`` Puppet class

``swk addgcls frontend nginx::verbose_access_logs``

You can also get description on an existing host:

::

    swk desc myhost

Output:

::

    [myhost.example_domain.com]:
    Hostgroup:  mysql
    OS:     Debian 7.9
    IP:     192.168.1.1
    Resource:   myhypervisor
    Env:        production
    Comment:    my favorite host!

Or search hosts by a given criteria (Foreman doesn't support everything
for a search criterias). There are two short keywords for convenience
now: hg for hostgroup and cls for class. Specifying several implies AND
logic:

::

    swk srch cls=my_awesome_puppet_class

Output:

::

    myhost

This way you can combine ``swk`` invocations in something really fun
like

::

    swk pssh "`swk srch cls=my_awesome_puppet_class`" reboot

Remember to use and escape quotes when needed!

``swk pssh ^mysql mysql -e 'show variables like "read_only"'`` won't
work (due to shell quote processing, it represents
``mysql -e show variables like "read only"``), but

``swk pssh ^mysql "mysql -e 'show variables like \"read_only\"'"`` will.

You can get more info on available parsers, commands and arguments by
running ``swk -h`` .

If you need to change your default SSH user, parallel processes count,
API credentials or such, take a look at **swk.ini** file located at
**~/.swk** .

Shell mode
''''''''''

If you run ``swk`` without any arguments, it starts in shell mode. Like
this:

::

    trueneu$ swk
    swk>

You can do absolutely all the same like in command line mode, but in
shell mode you don't need to think about quote escaping in tricky
commands, because the arguments are treated literally even if not
quoted.

For example, that ugly mysql example above would look like this in shell
mode:

::

    swk> pssh ^mysql mysql -e 'show variables like "read_only"'

Additionally, you may call any system utility from inside ``swk`` shell
via ``sys`` command or even omit ``sys``:

::

    swk> pssh ^mysql mysql -e 'show variables like "%format%"' | grep innodb

It also supports history through ``hist`` command, etc. To get help on
any command, issue ``help <command>`` or ``help`` without arguments to
get an overview.

Please note that shell mode doesn't support backticks yet, so if you
need to feed a hostlist to ``swk`` from somewhere, you should use stdin
approach:

::

    swk> srch cls=my_awesome_class | pssh - reboot

Details
~~~~~~~

Commands, hostgroup modifiers and parsers code are defined through swk
plugins. They can be connected to the main program in three ways: being
included in main package under **swk/plugins** dir, having a defined
**swk\_plugin** entry point in their setup.py and installed or just
being put in one of **plugins\_directories** dir from **swk.ini** file.

You can find some working plugins there mentioned above, as well as
dummy examples in **swk\_plugins\_examples** . Further help can be found
in **swk.classes**, which you MUST import when defining your own command
and/or parser modules.

For example, if you use Nagios in your environment, you can create a
parser that will expand a Nagios hostgroup into a hostlist, or a command
that will take a Nagios hostgroup and do something with it using Nagios
API (say, downtime it or something). Information that's used for modules
to work (such as authentication information for various APIs) may (and
should) be stored in config named **swk.ini**.

Shell mode parsing details
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When in shell mode, every argument starting with the third *to the end
of the line* is passed literally even if not quoted, backslashes being
escaped, and then it's shlexed down to a list respectful to quotes. It
sounds a little bit confusing at first, but it has its benefits. You do
not need to escape backslash character, and you don't need the outer
level of quoting when ssh\`ing this way.

Please note that these rules work only for ``swk`` commands. Everything
else is passed as you'd expect.

Trade-offs: - you may have to implement your own argument parsing in
command plugins for them to work correctly (using a whitespace or
something else as a delimiter). - you have to escape chaining/io
redirection characters for those to be passed as arguments to commmand
instead of work locally. For example, ``ssh remote echo ABC > file``
creates ``file`` on local machine, but ``ssh remote echo ABC \> file``
does the same on remote.

Why did I do this and why you may need this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I did it simply because there was no such instruments in my environment,
and I needed them from time to time. As a side note, I hate GUIs and web
interfaces for everything that shouldn't be necessary visualized (like
UML or statistic charts). And I just can't accept that I need to make 10
mouse clicks to change a host's environment in Foreman when I know
hostname and environment name exactly. So ``swiss-knife`` is a simple
instrument to make simple operations and its functionality can be
extended rather easily.

There's a few possible reasons you'll find it useful: - You are a system
administrator. If you're not, it's doubtfully be useful for you in any
way - You hate clicking GUIs just like me, and your GUI instrument(s)
has an API you could use - There's no such an instrument in your
environment: it's either de-centralized and/or you don't use
configuration management software and its tools heavily - You'd like to
glue altogether all the stuff you use in your environment to classify or
group hosts and you know a little bit of python

Known issues and notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As this is an alpha version under development, author wouldn't recommend
to think of ``swk`` as of a reliable tool suitable for running
important, potentially destructive tasks. i.e. restarting/reinstalling
important services, ``sed``\ ing mission critical configs, etc. Always
double-check command's result on one host before applying it to whole
production, use ``dr`` command.

No compatibility with future versions is guaranteed yet.

``casp`` is a nice piece of software written by my former colleague Stan
E. Putrya. It's not yet released to opensource, but I'm sure it will
eventually.

It should work on python2.7+, python3.2+.

Usage notes
           

-  currently, host cannot start with non-alphanumerical character. This
   breaks using something like (host\|hos)123 as a host as left bracket
   will be treated as a hostgroup modifier.
-  ssh module needs a running ssh-agent with private keys added, or
   private keys need to remain password free
-  username for ssh specified in **swk.ini** will override your current
   username and username from .ssh/config if present
-  Ctrl-C works poorly when pssh'ing (providing you unneeded tracebacks
   from multiprocessing)
-  interactive user input is NOT supported when running a command

Dev notes
         

-  if a parser doesn't return any hosts, its job is considered failed
   and desired command doesn't start
-  all the information needed to run a command is added to class
   attributes, more info on that in **swk\_classes**
-  all the information you've mentioned in config is also added to class
   attributes. Section must be named the same as the class that is being
   configured for this to work; **[Main]** section is for swk program
