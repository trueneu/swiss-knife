4. refactor the ssh module. it's very, very ugly.
8. come up with a name convention of module names and such
10. insert logging in plugins
13. catch paramiko.ssh_exception.% is ssh module
15. make mntnce command - maintenance adding/editing in zabbix
22. implement pip/easy_install ?
24. write own setup.py files for all the plugins? omg.
25. write commands do determine in which hostgroup(s) the host is. fdesc, zdesc?
26. make an interactive shell mode (pypsi?)
26.5 rewrite examples
26.8 rewrite sk-ssh ctrl+c exiting/catching if needed (it's unclear if it's needed)
27. add get/set/destroy Foreman parameters commands
28. fix passing wrong host to foreman getcls, try another cmds
29. dig into argparse vs shlex to avoid needless quote escaping -- Adam Meily, pypsi's author, seems to be willing to add such a feature.
    I don't think it's possible with shlex or anything, sadly, as the arguments in sys.argv are already un-quoted
30. remove debug prints from swiss_knife, sk-ssh
31. clean up sk-shell and pypsi sources, remove hacks and debug outputs
33. fix config installation
34. entry_points and pkg_resources import for possible pip plugin packages
36. make a customizable user plugin folder config parameter and also import from there
37. copy swk.ini to ~/.swk at install time
