Bugfixes
SSH: rewrite sk-ssh ctrl+c exiting/catching

Re-do
SSH: try to use fabric in ssh module?

Improvements
SSH: refactor the ssh module. it's very, very ugly.
Zabbix: make mntnce command - maintenance adding/editing in zabbix
FRMN/ZBX: write commands do determine in which hostgroup(s) the host is. fdesc, zdesc?
FRMN: add get/set/destroy Foreman parameters commands
FRMN: add new host/clone host to foreman plugin
SSH: gather/scp ~ expansion -- did for local paths
SSH: gather doesn't rename if it's just one host
SHELL: look into file path completion pypsi
SHELL: tab completion for hosts and/or hostgroups


General
- come up with a name convention of module names and such
- insert logging in plugins
- before pypi: review setup.pys, maybe there's additional info I'd like to add
- include example in readme: pssh xen-trueneu-test[2-5] sudo bash -c "git clone http://git.dgvg.ru/trueneu/in-place-utilities.git /root/scripts"
